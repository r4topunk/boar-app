# iOS device smoke test

TL;DR: build a signed Release on the build Mac, install on the iPhone, put the default model on it, ask one sourced question online and one in airplane mode, and record times plus memory. Target device: iPhone 13 (iPhone14,5, A15, 4GB RAM), iOS 26.6.2.

```bash
# Xcode 27 and the phone on the same Mac: build, sign, install, launch in one go.
# Only BOAR.app is kept, in builds/ios/iphoneos/ (ios/build is deleted).

```

The team id is in Xcode > Settings > Accounts on the build Mac. It stays in the environment and is never committed. The first install of a free-team build needs "trust developer" on the phone (Settings > General > VPN & Device Management).

## Steps

| # | Step | Pass when | Record |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Launch from the home screen | Setup wizard renders, no red box, nothing clipped by the Dynamic Island or home indicator | Screenshot, cold start in seconds |
| 2 | Get the models: downloader build → "minimum" tier (bge 37MB + Qwen2.5-1.5B 986MB) on Wi-Fi. Offline build → import the two GGUFs through the Files picker | Both show "Downloaded"/imported and the wizard completes | Download or import time, size on disk |
| 3 | Lock the phone for 30s mid-download (downloader build only) | Download resumes or continues; no restart from 0% | Behavior (`UNKNOWN` today) |
| 4 | Ask a question the corpus covers, e.g. "What is CRISPR and why does it matter for medicine?" (the built-in corpus has a CRISPR article; Bramble may change the corpus, so pick any title from `assets/corpus/corpus.json`) | Answer cites a source from the local corpus | TTFT, tok/s (Usage stats), `[BOAR mem]` lines during the answer |
| 5 | Turn on airplane mode (Wi-Fi and cellular off), kill and relaunch the app, ask a second question, e.g. "How do black holes form?" | Same quality of answer, no network error anywhere | TTFT, tok/s, memory |
| 6 | Voice button (if shown) | Works only if iOS has an on-device model for the locale; otherwise the button reports unavailable, never silently uses the network | Result |
| 7 | Background the app for 1 min during an answer, return | App is still alive (not jetsam-killed), answer finished or cleanly stopped | Survived yes/no |

## 1.5B vs 4B on the 4GB iPhone (v1.1 default decision)

The v1.1 default is Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 Q4_K_M. It stays the default on this phone only if, with n_ctx 2048, it (a) loads and answers without a jetsam kill and (b) decodes at ≥ ~6 tok/s. Otherwise the 4GB iPhone defaults to the Compact model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) via `pickDefaultAnswerModel(installed, totalRamBytes, fits)` in `src/routing/defaultModel.ts` (4B only above 4.5 GB and when its memory fit is not thrashing/insufficient), and the engine owner is told. The 4B catalog entry and id belong to the trust/offline owner.

Run steps 4 and 5 once per model (switch in Settings), same two questions, and fill:

| Model | Load (s) | TTFT (s) | Decode tok/s | Peak footprint (MB) | Min available (MB) | Jetsam? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B Q4_K_M (0.94 GB) | | | | | | |
| Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 Q4_K_M (2.5 GB) | | | | | | |

On this phone the rule already picks Compact (≤ 4.5 GB → 1.5B, n_ctx 2048 via `contextSizeForRam` in `src/inference/memoryFit.ts`), and the header-based fit predicts thrashing for the 4B (~0.7 GB buffers + 2.3 GB weights vs ~2 GB available). Select the 4B by hand in Settings and accept the warning; the point of the run is to confirm or refute that prediction.

Also record `getDeviceTotalRamBytes()` on this phone (expected ~3.7–4 GB, below the 4.5 GB threshold, so the rule picks Compact today).

## Memory to record

The iOS `ram-monitor` prints, at most every 5s while the UI polls memory:

```
[BOAR mem] rss_mb=... footprint_mb=... available_mb=...
```

- `footprint_mb` (phys_footprint) is what jetsam compares against the app's limit.
- `available_mb` (os_proc_available_memory) is the headroom left before the kill. `footprint + available` ≈ the app's limit on this phone.
- Record: at launch, after the model loads, peak during step 4 and step 5.

If the app dies without a log, check Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data for a `JetsamEvent` report around that time.

## Run 1: iPhone 13 (4 GB), integration 90b87dd, 2026-09-26

Partial run (about 5 minutes with the phone). The app installs and launches, but
no model gets a llama.cpp context, so no answer and no tok/s yet.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Build: team type (free / paid), stripped entitlements | Personal development team; `extended-virtual-addressing` and `increased-memory-limit` both stripped (the personal team rejects them) |
| Cold start (s) | not measured (the app opened, no trust prompt) |
| Model load (s) | failed, see below |
| Limit estimate at launch (footprint + available, MB) | 46 + 2051 = ~2.1 GB (no increased-memory-limit) |
| Peak footprint during answer (MB) | n/a (68 MB peak, the model never loaded) |
| Min available during answer (MB) | n/a |
| TTFT online / airplane (s) | n/a |
| Decode tok/s online / airplane | n/a |
| Survived background during answer | n/a |
| Screenshots | none (no UI automation on a physical iPhone) |

**Blocker: Metal fails to initialize on the device.** llama.rn 0.13.0-rc.4 is
built with `GGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=1`, so the shaders compile on the phone at
first use. That compile fails:

```
ggml_metal_init: the device does not have a precompiled Metal library - this is unexpected
ggml_metal_library_compile_all: failed to build 'fa' library: Error Domain=MTLLibraryErrorDomain Code=3
  "Compilation failed due to an interrupted connection: XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED ..."
ggml_metal_init: error: failed to initialize the Metal library
llama_init_from_model: failed to initialize the context: failed to initialize MTL0 backend
common_init_: failed to create context with model '.../qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4km.gguf'
common_init_: failed to create context with model '.../embedding.gguf'
```

This affects both models. The 1.5B loaded with `offloaded 0/29 layers to GPU`
(934.69 MiB CPU_Mapped), and its context still needs the Metal backend. The app
retried the load four times. The user's "model does not download" report is
most likely the load-error card sending them to setup (not verified on screen);
the log shows no network, URL, space or sha error. The simulator is not affected (bge indexed on the
simulator's Metal).

Next run (needs the phone):
0. Before anything: record free space (`xcrun devicectl device info details
   --device <id>`, storage / free capacity). The user suspects a full disk; the
   Metal compiler writes its shader cache to disk, so a full disk could explain
   XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED. If space is short, free it and retry
   before changing code.
1. Check whether it reproduces without `devicectl --console` (the compiler XPC
   may behave differently under the debugger launch).
2. Engine-side fallback (Tusk): on a context init failure, retry with the GPU
   off (llama.rn `n_gpu_layers: 0` plus no GPU devices / `flash_attn: false`),
   so the phone answers on the CPU instead of failing.
3. Try `flash_attn: false` alone: the failing library is 'fa'.
4. Then measure the 1.5B (footprint, tok/s). The 4B does not fit under the
   ~2.1 GB limit without increased-memory-limit, which needs a paid team with
   the capability on the App ID.

What JS sees: only `Failed to load model` (llama.rn `cpp/jsi/RNLlamaJSI.cpp:715`).
The Metal details stay in the native log, so any fallback or error UI has to
key on that string, not on "Metal"/"MTL".

UNKNOWN: whether the XPC compile failure is a full disk, memory pressure on the 4 GB phone,
an iOS 26.6 issue, or caused by the debugger launch.
