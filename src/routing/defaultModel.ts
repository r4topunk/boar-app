 * The 4B is dense: every token reads all 2.5 GB of weights, so it is only a
 * good default when it can stay resident. Rule: the catalog's "default" tier
 * model if the device has more than 4.5 GB of RAM, its memory fit is
 * "resident" or "streaming" and it was not measured under 6 tok/s; otherwise
 * the "compact" one. 4 GB phones (iPhone 13) always get the compact model.

 * tier can: the largest one measured at 6 tok/s or more.

 * Pure: the setup wizard, the boot route, the model list and the answer
 * pipeline call it with the installed (or offered) models and the device
